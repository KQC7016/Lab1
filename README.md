1. Study and run [***`lab1.py`***](/lab1.py)
2. Run the code and examine the input for every ‘part’ of the code
   * You may need to use # to print only one part of output at a time.
3. Prepare a report to explain the function performed in this code, with the help of the print screen of the output.
4. Modify the code to perform web scraping on another website.
   * You may add additional functions to the code.

### tkinter
---
There are no additional steps required to install the Tkinter library in an Anaconda environment, because the Tkinter library is usually part of the Python standard library, so it is automatically installed with the Python installation.   
However, in some cases, especially on macOS systems, it may be necessary to manually install the Tkinter library.  
  
You can make sure the Tkinter library is installed by running the following command:  

```css
conda list tkinter
```
If the Tkinter library is installed, you will see it in the list. If it is not installed, you can try to install it using the following command:
```css
conda install tk
```

## Lab 1 - Web Scraping (5%)

1. Study and run [***`lab1.py`***](/lab1.py)
2. Run the code and examine the input for every ‘part’ of the code
   * You may need to use # to print only one part of output at a time.
3. Prepare a report to explain the function performed in this code, with the help of the print screen of the output.
4. Modify the code to perform web scraping on another website.
   * You may add additional functions to the code.

## Environment

### Python Version
**`Python`** **`3.9.18`**

### Libraries Used
1. [***datetime***](#datetime)
2. [***time***](#datetime)
3. [***tkinter***](#datetime)
4. [***selenium***](#datetime)
5. [***pathlib***](#datetime)

#### datetime
  
The datetime library is Python's standard library, so there is usually no need to install it separately, it is already included in the Python installation.  
  
If you need to check whether the datetime library is installed, you can run the following command on the command line:  
```css
pip show datetime
```
If the datetime library has been installed, the command line will display relevant information, including the version number and installation path.

If you need to update the datetime library, you can run the following command:  
```css
pip install --upgrade datetime
```
If you encounter permission issues when running the above command, you can try adding sudo before the command to use administrator privileges:  
```css
sudo pip install --upgrade datetime
```
  
#### time
```css

```

#### tkinter
There are no additional steps required to install the Tkinter library in an Anaconda environment, because the Tkinter library is usually part of the Python standard library, so it is automatically installed with the Python installation. However, in some cases, especially on macOS systems, it may be necessary to manually install the Tkinter library.
  
You can make sure the Tkinter library is installed by running the following command:  

```css
conda list tkinter
```
```css

```
If the Tkinter library is installed, you will see it in the list. If it is not installed, you can try to install it using the following command:
```css
conda install tk
```

#### selenium
```css

```

#### pathlib
```css

```

#### BeautifulSoup

```css
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

Install in Anaconda environment
```css
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

```css

```
#### Install dependent libraries in Anaconda environment

Activate your Anaconda environment (if you want to install these libraries in a specific environment)
